## Silent HIll 3 HD Voice Pack Version 6.0 Update

- Normalized all in-game event audio. Now the cutscenes can finally be audible for people with low end systems which have bad onboard audio.

- All audio has been reported and looping errors left in by Hijinx have fixed.

- Fixed Event 017 and 018 loop. (Heather finds Harry dead in the apartment and meets claudia on the roof )

- Improved Event 020 Loop (Heather decides to go to Silent Hill.)

- Fixed Event 045 (Heather meets Claudia and Vincent in the Church) The audio would cut off at the end in the HD Collection rather abruptly. This has been fixed with a fadeout.

- Fixed Event 046 (Heather fails and you get a gameover) The audio in the HD Collection would cut off abruptly. This has been fixed with a fadeout.

- Fixed Event 047 idle loop (Claudia uh... birthes.. I have no idea how to describe this..) in the HD Collection the audio was looped incorrectly and the idle loop isn't even the same the original game. The original loop has been restored and looped correctly.

- Fixed Event 024 Loop (Hospital Leanord Phone Call) Looped was butchered and broken in the HD Collection due to the team using the OST version and looping that badly. it's only 99.8% perfect but over 9000 times better then what shipped. 

- Fixed Event 004 and 004 Loops. The songs were looped incorrectly due to the team using the OST version of the song. 

- Fixed Event 006 Loop (Heather meets Claudia) This song was actually looped correctly but the loop was actually broken by Team Silent in PC and PS2 versions.. weird. I tried to correct the loop as best as I could.

- Fixed Event 001 Loop again. (The first cutscene with Heather at the Amusment Park when you start a new game) bugged loop by Hijinx again.

- Fixed Event 030. Music cuts out abruptly during the fade to black. Fixed with a fadeout.

- Migrated to the new AFS File Emulation Framework for handling of Audio Redirection, this solution is more optimized and faster and less buggy.
